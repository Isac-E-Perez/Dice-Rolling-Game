# Dice Rolling Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented a random dice rolling simulator using Python. I used the libraries tkinter, Image and ImageTk from PIL and random which helped me to build the project. The library tkinter offered the user interface while Image and ImageTk allowed for the images to be opened. The random library assisted in randomly choosing 1 through 6 of the die images.
 
### Results: 

First, I created the initialize window for my project.

Afterwards, I created and formatted the labels for the user interface application.

Next, I formed a list of images to be randomly displayed.

Then, I constructed a label for an image, added a button and assigned funcitonality of the button.

Finally, I closed the mainloop which is the last command given to compile all the previous commands and displays the window as soon as the program is running.
